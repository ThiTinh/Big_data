This project constructs a big data ecosystem by employing data exploration, machine learning techniques with big data, and graph analysis. The dataset simulates big data generated from a large number of users who are playing an imaginary game called "Catch the Pink Flamingo".


- Critically evaluate the three big data processing paradigms as discussed during the course.

- Develop and implement a big data solution that covers the following:

+ Data Exploration: including acquiring, cleaning, exploring and preparing the data for analysis;
any relevant data exploration tool/visualisation that could fit the purpose is allowed to be used.

+ Machine learning with big data: applying classification & clustering techniques on the proposed dataset.

+ Graph Analysis: Using Neo4j/ Gephi to perform graph analytics of the simulated chat data to find ways of
improving the game.

+ Discuss and visualise the resulting data insights.

+ Evaluate the role of ethics on data storage and processing.
